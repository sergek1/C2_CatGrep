     1	In today's society, decisions are made on the basis of data. Most scientific or industrial studies and experiments produce
     2	data, and the analysis of these data and drawing useful conclusions from them have become one of the central issues.



     3	Statistics is an integral part of the cat quantitative approach to knowledge. The field of statistics is concerned with the scientific
     4	study of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Statistics benefits all of us because of its

     5	ability to predict the future based on data we have previously gathered. Statistical CAT methods help us to transform data into
     6	information and knowledge. Statistical concepts enable cat us to solve problems in a diversity of contexts, add substance to

     7	decisions, and reduce guesswork. The discipline textbook of statistics stemmed from the need to place cat knowledge management on a



     8	CAT
     9	systematic evidence base. TEXTBOOK Earlier works on statistics dealt only with the collection, organization, and presentation of data in
    10	the form cat of tables and charts. In order to place CAT statistical textbook knowledge on a systematic evidence base, we require a study of
    11	the laws of CAT probability. In mathematical TEXTBOOK statistics we create a probabilistic model cat and view the data as a set of random


    12	outcomes from that model. TEXTBOOK Advances in probability theory enable us to draw valid conclusions and to make reasonable
    13	decisions on the basis of data. textbook
